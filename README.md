I recently started watching RubyConf talks. I was motivated to learn more about Ruby. Specifically, watching Sandi Metz talk about coding got me really interested in Ruby. So here I am. Still watching RubyConf videos. One day, I'd like to go to a Ruby Conference. Or Convention. If they'll have me. I promise not to bother anyone. I'll pretend I belong. Soon enough, I might actually fit in.

## First things first though:

	- Learn Ruby the Hard Way - Zed A. Shaw
	- Ruby on Rails Tutorial - Michael Hartl
	- ???
	- profit.....
